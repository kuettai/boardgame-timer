## Immediate Action Items

### Start Coding Now - Task 1.2

1. **Create HTML Structure** (30 minutes):
   ```html
   <!-- Basic full-screen layout with setup form -->
   <!DOCTYPE html>
   <html lang="en">
   <head>
     <meta charset="UTF-8">
     <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
     <title>BoardGame Timer</title>
   </head>
   <body>
     <div id="app">
       <div id="setup-screen" class="screen active">
         <!-- Player setup form -->
       </div>
       <div id="game-screen" class="screen">
         <!-- Timer interface -->
       </div>
     </div>
   </body>
   </html>
   ```

2. **Create Base CSS** (45 minutes):
   - Mobile-first responsive design
   - Full-screen layout
   - CSS custom properties for theming

3. **Implement Player Setup Logic** (3-4 hours):
   - Player form with add/remove functionality
   - Color picker integration
   - Validation logic
   - Visual player preview

4. **Add Setup Form Styles** (1-2 hours):
   - Form styling
   - Color picker styling
   - Responsive layout
   - Touch-friendly buttons

### Development Tips

**Mobile-First Approach**:
- Start with 320px width
- Use `rem` units for scalability
- Touch targets minimum 44px
- Test on actual mobile device

**Color Picker Options**:
- HTML5 `<input type="color">`
- Predefined color palette
- Ensure sufficient contrast

**Validation Strategy**:
- Real-time validation feedback
- Clear error messages
- Prevent form submission if invalid

### Testing Checklist for Task 1.2

- [ ] Form works on mobile (320px width)
- [ ] Can add/remove players (2-8 range)
- [ ] Color picker functions properly
- [ ] Duplicate validation works
- [ ] Mode selection toggles correctly
- [ ] Visual preview updates in real-time
- [ ] Form submission triggers game start

## Ready to Begin

**Current Status**: Project structure created âœ…  
**Next Task**: Player Setup Interface  
**Estimated Time**: 1 day  
**Priority**: High (blocks all other development)

Start with creating `frontend/index.html` and basic CSS structure. Focus on getting the player setup form working before moving to timer implementation.
